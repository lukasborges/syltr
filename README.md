# Syltr

An all-in-one messaging service aggregator, native to **GNOME**. It gathers
WhatsApp Web, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Messenger and any other web service into
a single window — each with its own **isolated session** (separate cookies and
storage).

**Stack:** GTK4 · libadwaita · WebKitGTK 6 · Rust

## Features

- Icon rail with real favicons (SVG included) and an active-item highlight
- Add services from a catalog or by custom URL
- **Reorder** services by dragging · **context menu** (right click)
- **Unread badges** on the icon (detected from the page title)
- **Native desktop notifications** · **mute** per service · global **do not disturb**
- **Spell checking** with the system dictionaries (enchant/hunspell)
- Links clicked in messages (`target=_blank`) open in the **default browser**; SSO popups and in-service navigation stay in-app, with back/forward
- Isolated session per service (independent login for each)
- Downloads saved straight to `~/Downloads` with a completion notification
- Camera, microphone and WebRTC call support
- Service list persisted in `~/.config/dev.syltr.Syltr/services.json`

### Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+1` … `Ctrl+9` | Go to service N |
| `Ctrl+PgDown` / `Alt+↓` | Next service |
| `Ctrl+PgUp` / `Alt+↑` | Previous service |
| `Ctrl+N` | Add service |
| `Ctrl+R` / `F5` | Reload |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit |

## Development

Install the dependencies (Arch Linux):

```bash
./scripts/install-deps.sh          # toolchain, GTK4/libadwaita, WebKitGTK, spell check
./scripts/install-deps.sh --no-ide # skip GNOME Builder
```

Build and run:

```bash
cargo run
```

Useful environment variables:

- `SYLTR_DEBUG=1` — forward the pages' JS errors/warnings to stderr
- `SYLTR_LOCALE_DIR` — override the translations directory

### Media codecs (WhatsApp video)

WebKitGTK plays media through **GStreamer**, so H.264/AAC (WhatsApp videos)
work with the system codecs — on Arch, install `gst-plugins-good` and
`gst-libav`. No engine rebuild involved.

### Camera, microphone and calls

Media capture and WebRTC are enabled for all services. On Arch they require
`gst-plugin-pipewire`, `gst-plugins-bad` and `libnice`. WebKitGTK's PipeWire
device monitor is known to crash on some systems, so this support remains
experimental despite being enabled by default.

### Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

Unit tests are colocated with the code they test: a module gains a `tests`
submodule declared as `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;`, with the tests living in a
sibling `tests.rs` inside the module folder (e.g. `src/engine/unread/tests.rs`).
This keeps them out of the release build and gives them access to the module's
internal (`pub(crate)`/private) items.

## Architecture

The app talks to the web engine **only** through the public `engine::ServiceView`
API and never touches `webkit6` directly. Each module is split into a folder by
responsibility:

| Path              | Responsibility                                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `src/main.rs`     | `AdwApplication` startup, i18n, CSS, embedded resources     |
| `src/window/`     | Window, rail, view stack, actions, dialogs, context menu    |
| `src/engine/`     | Web engine layer (WebKitGTK 6): sessions, favicons, unread, downloads, `ServiceView` |
| `src/config/`     | Service list, settings and their XDG file locations         |
| `src/spellcheck.rs` | Discovery of system spell-check dictionaries             |
| `src/catalog.rs`  | Catalog of known services ("recipes")                       |
| `src/icon.rs`     | The service icon (tile + favicon + unread badge)            |

### Web engine (WebKitGTK 6)

Each service is a `webkit6::WebView` with its own **`NetworkSession`**
(cookies, storage and cache isolated under the service's session directory).
The rest of the app depends only on `ServiceView` (`new`, `widget`, `icon`,
`reload`, `go_back`, `go_forward`, `go_home`, `set_notifications_enabled`,
`set_spell_languages`), so the engine internals stay contained in `src/engine/`.

Compatibility choices carried in the engine: hardware acceleration is off (the
web process crashes compositing Teams), media capture/WebRTC is enabled despite
known PipeWire device-monitor crashes on some systems, and a startup script
shims `Notification.permission` and `requestIdleCallback`.
